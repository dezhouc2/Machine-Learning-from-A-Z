```python
   
   idea: input layers, hidden layers and output layers; how these three layers interact with each other.
   
   - input layer: a combination of many values such as X1,X2....Xm
   
     - action: weight each of the values and then pass into inner layer
       
       - purpose of weight: denote which values are important
   
   - inner layer: sum of wixi for i = 1,....m and then apply activiation function and then signal pass into output layer
     
     * activation function:
       - sigmoid function: y = 1/(1 + e^(-x))
       
       - thresold function: y = 1 if x >= 0 and y = 0 if x < 0
       
       - rectify function: y = max(x,0)


   - output layer: apply sigmoind function and then output values
