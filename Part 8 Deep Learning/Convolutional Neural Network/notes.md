```python
  * what are convolutional neural network?
    - purpose: image classification


    - idea:
      input image -> cnn -> output label(classify image)
      
      
    - how cnn classifies?
      - eg: black and white image -> transfer into 2d array
      
      - eg: green,red,blue image -> transfer into 3d array

    - overall process:
      - step 1: convolution
      
      - step 2: max pooling
      
      - step 3: flattening
      
      - step 4: full connection
