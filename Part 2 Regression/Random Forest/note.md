```python

- ensemble learning
  - definition: put several algos or same algos multiple time to make it stronger than original 
  
  - advantages: more stable
  
  - methodology:
    1. pick randomly K data points from the training set
    
    2. build decision tree based on these K data points
    
    3. choose number of Ntree want to build and repeat 1&2
    
    4.for a new data point, make each of Ntree predict the Y value for the data point; 
      The Y value of new data point will be the average acrossing all of the predicted Y values
