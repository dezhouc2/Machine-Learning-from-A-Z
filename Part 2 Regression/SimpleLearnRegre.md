* Simple Linear Regression:
  - ^Y(expected value) = b0(constant) + b1(coefficient)X1(independent variable) 
  
  - Ordinary Least Squares
    -residual = ^yi - yi #表示预测的点和真实点之间的区别
    
    - finding the b0 and b1 such that minimize the sum(yi-yi^)^2 to find the best linear regression


  - assumptions of linear regress(5 assumption):
    - linear relationship between x and y
    
    - each data has euqal variance 

    - data points follow normal distribution

    - data points are indpendent from each other
    
    - independent variables are not correlated to each other
