```python
- usage of polynomial linear regression: when there is no linear relationship between y and x

- linear: how coefficient affects the y and x

- equation: y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x1^2 + b3x1^3 + ... + bnx1^n

- question: why called polynominal linear regression? 
 - answer: we need to find all b1,b2,b3...bn to find out if there are linear relationship between Y and X


- transform input attribute with some degree into polynomial attribute to train model
  - for example: using PolynomialFeatures(degree=2) to set up attribute with degree of 2
    - if 4 degree, then equation becomes y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x1^2 + b3x1^3 + b4x1^4
