```python

- cares about errors outside of the tubes(these are support vectors), we try to minimize these suppor vectors
  - compare to linear regression, we try to minimize sum(y-y^2)^2

- have no coefficients for each of the feature as in linear regression, therefore need to implement feature scaling(either normailziation or standardization)

- summary: have inexcility relationship between x and y, then need to apply feature scaling(put values of dependent variables and values of 
  independent variables in the same range)


- using feature scaling for both X and Y
  - when predict, we need to inverse transform and predict the coresponding Y for the inverse transform X
