* Regreesion:
  - Linear Regression
    - pros:
      works on any size of dataset, gives information about feature relevance
      
    - cons:
      linear regression assumption
  
  
  - Polynomial Regression
    - pros:
      any size of dataset, do well on non-linear problems
    
    - cons:
      select the right polynomial degree for good bias/variance tradeoff
  
  
  - SVR 
    - pros:
      do well on non-linear problems, not biased by outliers 
      
    - cons:
      need to apply feature scaling
      
  
  - Decision Tree Regression
    - pros:
      no need for feature scaling; work on both linear/non-linear problems
    
    - cons:
      poor results on small datasets and less features, maybe overfitting
  
  
  - Random Forest Regression
    - pros:
      no need for feature scaling; work well on linear/non-linear problems
      
    - cons:
      choose the right numbers of trees, need big datasets; sometimes overfitting
