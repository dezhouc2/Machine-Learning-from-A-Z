```python

note: no need to feature scaling for both decision tree and random forest since they both are based on the splitting chunks

- no adapt to one single feature dataset, more adapted to multiple feature-columns dataset(more features, better)

- main idea: 
  1.split dataset into chunks
  2.each chunk has an average value(representing for Y)
  3.for each new input, output will result the corresponding Y for this new input

- two types of decision tree
  - classification trees(predict )
    
  
  - regression trees(predict numeric variable)
