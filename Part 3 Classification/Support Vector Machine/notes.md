```python
  - svm有两种形式 取决于kernel的选择
    - linear kernel; bounary is linear straight line
    
    - non-linear kernel; bounary is a curve


  - maximum margin
    
    - a straight line to split clusters; maximum margin classifier
    
      - split into positive hyperplane (one cluster)
      
      - negative hyperplane(another cluster)
    
    
    - support vectors(the data points that nearest to both positive hyperplane and negative hyperplan)


  - definition: split the clusters based on the the extreme cases from each of the cluster
