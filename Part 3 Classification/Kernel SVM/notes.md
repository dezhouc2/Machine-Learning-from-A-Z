  * linearly separable
    - linearly separable
      - finding the optimal decision line that we can draw
    
    
    - not linearly separable
  
  * idea: convert the non-linear separable into linearly separable via a function that mapping into a higher dimension
    - once defined as linearly separable then we can can projection back to original space while separating the cluster
    
    
  * Kernel function
    * Gaussian RBF Kernel(kernel trick)
      - create non-linear separation without going into higher dimensions

      - 通过计算kernel 得出一个value, 然后通过这个value来分类 data points 是属于哪个一个cluster

    * sigmoid kernel 
    
    
    * polynomial kernel
