```python
  * definition: 
    - define number of k neighbors usually k >= 5
    
    - take the k nearest neighbors of new data point, according to the euclidean distance
    
      - euclidean distance: p1(x1,y1), p2(x2,y2); euclidean distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
    
    - via k neighbors, count number of data points in each category
    
    - assign the new data points to the category where counts the most neighbors



  * non-linear classifier 
    - bounary is a curve rather than a linear line
    
    - performance better than logistic regression
    
    - can we do better? check out svm
