```python
  * belongs to Ensemble learning(one of the learning techniques)
  
  *idea:
    1. split dataset into training set and testing set
    
    2. pick randomly K data points from training set
    
    3. build decision tree based on these K data points
    
    4. set up #numbers of tree to build and repeat step 2 and 3 
    
    5. each of the decision trees predicts a value from testing set, the final value will be the majority of the categorical
