```python

  * Bayes' theorem:
    mathematical term: P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) | P(B)


  * "Naive":
    * assumption(not always true but still be be applied into real-world):
      - independent
        - variable needs to be independent from each other within dataset
        
        - feature needs to be independent from each other(no collinear)
