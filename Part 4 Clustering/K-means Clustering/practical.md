```python
  - do not know what to predict but would like to identify some patterns within dataset
   
  - since we do not have a dependent variable, then we don't need to split dataset into training set and testing set
  
  - we can only select the specific features that are important to implement K-means clustering as X dataframe
    - delete Y dataframe
  
  
  - use elbow method to find the optimal numbers of clusters
    - X-axis represents the number of cluster
    
    - Y-axis represents the corresponding WCSS value
  
    - Q: optimal number? A: the number starts to decrease slowly(depends on the angle range)
    
    
  - implement a parameter to avoid random initilization trap; "K-means++"
